# RustWordGame
A basic hangman game I will be using to learn about data types basic i/o, and package management in Rust.

This package can be compiled into the word game by navigating to the project directory and typing

cargo build

To run the project immediately after building in one command, type

cargo run

The words used for the game are randomly selected from the file src/dictionary.txt.
In order to play the game, you must have this file in the directory in which you execute the program binary.
